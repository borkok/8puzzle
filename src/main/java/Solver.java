When considering the neighbors of a search node, donâ€™t enqueue a neighbor
if its board is the same as the board of the previous search node in the game tree

To avoid recomputing the Manhattan priority of a search node from scratch each time
during various priority queue operations, pre-compute its value when you construct
the search node; save it in an instance variable; and return the saved value as needed.
